        Hi! I'm a third-year transfer student to UCSD who is majoring in 
        Data Science. I am very open to adapting and learning new things.
        Some of my skills include time management, analytical thinking, 
        and organization skills. In addition to that, I have great work 
        ethics, taking responsibilities to ensure me and my group meet 
        any deadline. Outside of school, I enjoy some personal me-time 
        by drawing, creating origami, and playing social games.
